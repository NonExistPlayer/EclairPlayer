# What is Eclair?
**Eclair** is an [open source](https://github.com/NonExistPlayer/EclairPlayer) audio player written in C# using the [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) framework and the [LibVLCSharp](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp) library, which is gradually being developed.

# Why Eclair?
**Eclair** is an attempt to create an alternative to existing audio players, for those who value the appearance of the program and who care about it. This player is a new player.

# Why Eclair open source?
I, [NonExistPlayer](https://github.com/NonExistPlayer) support free software.<br>
I don't think my hobby should be closed source.<br>
I enjoy developing this project despite the difficulties and problems I encounter when developing with **Eclair**.
