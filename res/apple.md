My project **Eclair** is not intended for `iOS` and `MacOS` platforms.
# Why?
Since I do not have an `iOS` or `MacOS` device, I cannot test the correct operation on these devices. So officially the project **Eclair** will not be released for the `iOS` and `MacOS` platforms.
# Anyone can compile for these devices
Because the source code of **Eclair** is open, anyone can try to compile the source code of **Eclair** for devices on `iOS` or `MacOS` if they want.
# About Pull Requests
_Pull Requests_ that only aim to work correctly or improve something for the previously mentioned devices will be rejected for the reason stated in the first sentence.
