title: A great loss
category: post

All people make mistakes, I am no exception. This is what happened: I deleted the disk partition with my projects,
of course, having saved the data on it before. But I did all this on a bootable flash drive with a
Linux distribution. It just so happened that I saved this data to the home folder on the bootable
flash drive, and before rebooting, I forgot about this data, since I was transferring the startup sector
of one of the partitions, it took a long time (about an hour), and it is clear that I could forget during such a time.

I remembered about this when I had already launched my main Linux distribution.
# So what did I lose?
Well, at least the Keystore for the Android version of my player. This can be survived, considering that
I did not release the player to any app stores and that my player is not so
popular, then the loss is not that big. Oh yeah! I lost my developments on the site!

I'm not even talking about this post now. And about the new main page and other things. Oh! It's a shame!

But what can you do? Soon, I think I'll create a new Keystore and make backups of it. And I'll also improve the site again in my free time.<br>
*After all, starting to do something anew is a reason to do it better*.
