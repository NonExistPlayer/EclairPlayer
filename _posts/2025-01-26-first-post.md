This is the first post for **Eclair**! And my first post at all.

I am very happy that I was able to create this site and set it up so that it could display posts and news.

It was difficult for me, but I still managed to do it!

In this post I will try to tell you what the player looks like, share my thoughts on the development, etc. I think this post will be, so to speak, historical.

So, at the moment the player looks... well... normal?.. I think that for a fifth-grader this is more than good.

## Interesting facts
Since I donâ€™t know what to tell about this player, I will share a few interesting facts:
- I started making this player two weeks before my birthday.
- My mom loves eclairs.
- At the time of writing this post I am 12 years old. And I started making **Eclair** when I was 11.
- Before **Eclair** I had a game that I later abandoned. In general, a typical pet project.

## Plans
Well... Add notifications or mini-audio players to PC and make an installer for Windows and packages for Linux. And the rest you can see in the list of tasks in the repository.

I also think about releasing the v0.2.2 update soon.

Well, that's basically it! Mostly this post was a kind of test. So... that's it!
